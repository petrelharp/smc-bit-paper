	abstract = {In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population during a forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulation. This dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by simulating only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants), and recording history as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. We implement the method in two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks, which speeds up large, whole-genome simulations by one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, the method has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a simulation's entire final generation (and its' history) rather than only a subset. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. To make these possible, we introduce the msprime Tables API, which allows for the efficient interchange of tree sequences between modular program components, and provide an algorithm to quickly simplify a tree sequence by removing history irrelevant to a given set of genomes.},

Specifically, the way random models of reproduction are used in coalescent theory is not justified. Instead, the population pedigree for diploid organisms-that is, the set of all family relationships among members of the population-although unknown, should be treated as a fixed parameter, not as a random quantity. Gene genealogical models should describe the outcome of the percolation of genetic lineages through the population pedigree according to Mendelian inheritance. Using simulated pedigrees, some of which are based on family data from 19th century Sweden, we show that in many cases the (conceptually wrong) standard coalescent model is difficult to reject statistically, and in this sense may provide a surprisingly accurate description of gene genealogies on a fixed pedigree. We study the differences between the fixed-pedigree coalescent and the standard coalescent by analysis and simulations. Differences are apparent in recent past generations, roughly {\textbackslash}textless log(2) (N) generations, but then disappear as genetics lineages are traced into the more distant past.},

There is a consequent increasing need for methods that are able to efficiently simulate such data. In this paper we implement the sequentially Markovian coalescent algorithm described by McVean and Cardin and present a further modification to that algorithm which slightly improves the closeness of the approximation to the full coalescent model. The algorithm ignores a class of recombination events known to affect the behavior of the genealogy of the sample, but which do not appear to affect the behavior of generated samples to any substantial degree. Results: We show that our software is able to simulate large chromosomal regions, such as those appropriate in a consideration of genome-wide data, in a way that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing coalescent algorithms. Conclusion: This algorithm provides a useful resource for those needing to simulate large quantities of data for chromosomal-length regions using an approach that is much more efficient than traditional coalescent models. © 2006 Marjoram and Wall; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The complex correlation structure of a collection of orthologous DNA sequences is uniquely captured by the "ancestral recombination graph" (ARG), a complete record of coalescence and recombination events in the history of the sample. However, existing methods for ARG inference are computationally intensive, highly approximate, or limited to small numbers of sequences, and, as a consequence, explicit ARG inference is rarely used in applied population genomics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm for ARG inference that is efficient enough to apply to dozens of complete mammalian genomes. The key idea of our approach is to sample an ARG of n chromosomes conditional on an ARG of n-1 chromosomes, an operation we call "threading." Using techniques based on hidden Markov models, we can perform this threading operation exactly, up to the assumptions of the sequentially Markov coalescent and a discretization of time. An extension allows for threading of subtrees instead of individual sequences. Repeated application of these threading operations results in highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for ARGs. We have implemented these methods in a computer program called ARGweaver. Experiments with simulated data indicate that ARGweaver converges rapidly to the posterior distribution over ARGs and is effective in recovering various features of the ARG for dozens of sequences generated under realistic parameters for human populations. In applications of ARGweaver to 54 human genome sequences from Complete Genomics, we find clear signatures of natural selection, including regions of unusually ancient ancestry associated with balancing selection and reductions in allele age in sites under directional selection. The patterns we observe near protein-coding genes are consistent with a primary influence from background selection rather than hitchhiking, although we cannot rule out a contribution from recurrent selective sweeps. © 2014 Rasmussen et al.},

The results concerning the number of segregating sites and the expected homozygosity indicate that a two-locus model and the infinite-site model behave similarly for 4Nu ≤ 2 and r ≤ 5u, where N is the population size, u is the neutral mutation rate, and r is the recombination rate.

These studies indicate that the estimates of the average number of nucleotide differences and nucleon diversity have a large variance, and a large part of this variance is due to stochastic factors.

	abstract = {We introduce a new statistical model for patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among multiple SNPs in a population sample. The model overcomes limitations of existing approaches to understanding, summarizing, and interpreting LD by (i) relating patterns of LD directly to the underlying recombination process; (ii) considering all loci simultaneously, rather than pairwise; (iii) avoiding the assumption that LD necessarily has a "block-like" structure; and (iv) being computationally tractable for huge genomic regions (up to complete chromosomes). We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify fine-scale variation in recombination rate from population data.

The technique is Metropolis-Hastings sampling: we explore a large number of possible reconstructions of the recombinant genealogy, weighting according to their posterior probability with regard to the data and working values of the parameters. Different relative rates of recombination at different locations can be accommodated if they are known from external evidence, but the algorithm cannot itself estimate rate differences. The estimates of ⌰ are accurate and apparently unbiased for a wide range of parameter values. However, when both ⌰ and r are relatively low, very long sequences are needed to estimate r accurately, and the estimates tend to be biased upward. We apply this method to data from the human lipoprotein lipase locus.},

The sequential Markov coalescent method is an approximation to the coalescent suggested by McVean and Cardin, and by Marjoram and Wall. Within this algorithm we compute, for two individuals randomly sampled from the population, the correlation between times to the most recent common ancestor and the linkage probability corresponding to two different loci with recombination rate R between them. These quantities characterise the linkage between the two loci in question. We find that the sequential Markov coalescent method approximates the coalescent well in general in models with demographic structure. An exception is the case where individuals are sampled from populations separated by reduced gene flow. In this situation, the correlations may be significantly underestimated. We explain why this is the case.},

I t is found that a single sample of chromosomes, examined at two loci cannot provide sufficient information for such a test if C {\textless} 10, because with C this small, very high levels of linkage disequilibrium are not unexpected under the neutral model. In samples of size 50, it is found that, even when C is as large as 50, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium conditional on the allele frequencies is substantially different from the distribution when there is no linkage between the loci.

Unlike previous methods, which employ the Sequentially Markov Coalescent approximation, ARGinfer uses the Coalescent with Recombination, allowing more accurate inference of key evolutionary parameters. We show using simulations that ARGinfer can accurately estimate many properties of the evolutionary history of the sample, including the topology and branch lengths of the genealogical tree at each sequence site, and the times and locations of mutation and recombination events. ARGinfer approximates posterior probability distributions for these and other quantities, providing interpretable assessments of uncertainty that we show to be well calibrated.

Thanks to recent progress in algorithms and data structures, simulators such as the widely-used msprime now provide genome-wide simulations for millions of individuals. However, this software relies on classic coalescent theory and its assumptions that sample sizes are small and that the region being simulated is short. Here we show that coalescent simulations of long regions of the genome exhibit large biases in identity-by-descent (IBD), long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD), and ancestry patterns, particularly when the sample size is large. We present a Wright-Fisher extension to msprime, and show that it produces more realistic distributions of IBD, LD, and ancestry proportions, while also addressing more subtle biases of the coalescent. Further, these extensions are more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art coalescent simulations when simulating long regions, including whole-genome data. For shorter regions, efficiency can be maintained via a hybrid model which simulates the recent past under the Wright-Fisher model and uses coalescent simulations in the distant past.},

	abstract = {Recombination is an ongoing and increasingly important feature of circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2, challenging how we represent the evolutionary history of this virus and giving rise to new variants of potential public health concern by combining transmission and immune evasion properties of different lineages. Detection of new recombinant strains is challenging, with most methods looking for breaks between sets of mutations that characterise distinct lineages. In addition, many basic approaches fundamental to the study of viral evolution assume that recombination is negligible, in that a single phylogenetic tree can represent the genetic ancestry of the circulating strains. Here we present an initial version of sc2ts, a method to automatically detect recombinants in real time and to cohesively integrate them into a genealogy in the form of an ancestral recombination graph (ARG), which jointly records mutation, recombination and genetic inheritance. We infer two ARGs under different sampling strategies, and study their properties. One contains 1.27 million sequences sampled up to June 30, 2021, and the second is more sparsely sampled, consisting of 657K sequences sampled up to June 30, 2022. We find that both ARGs are highly consistent with known features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, recovering the basic backbone phylogeny, mutational spectra, and recapitulating details on the majority of known recombinant lineages. Using the well-established and feature-rich tskit library, the ARGs can also be stored concisely and processed efficiently using standard Python tools. For example, the ARG for 1.27 million sequences—encoding the inferred reticulate ancestry, genetic variation, and extensive metadata—requires 58MB of storage, and loads in less than a second. The ability to fully integrate the effects of recombination into downstream analyses, to quickly and automatically detect new recombinants, and to utilise an efficient and convenient platform for computation based on well-engineered technologies makes sc2ts a promising approach.},

While much attention has been paid to the relatively recent gene flow from Neanderthals and Denisovans into modern humans, other instances of introgression leave more subtle genomic evidence and have received less attention. Here, we present a major extension of the ARGweaver algorithm, called ARGweaver-D, which can infer local genetic relationships under a user-defined demographic model that includes population splits and migration events. This Bayesian algorithm probabilistically samples ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) that specify not only tree topologies and branch lengths along the genome, but also indicate migrant lineages. The sampled ARGs can therefore be parsed to produce probabilities of introgression along the genome. We show that this method is well powered to detect the archaic migration into modern humans, even with only a few samples. We then show that the method can also detect introgressed regions stemming from older migration events, or from unsampled populations. We apply it to human, Neanderthal, and Denisovan genomes, looking for signatures of older proposed migration events, including ancient humans into Neanderthal, and unknown archaic hominins into Denisovans. We identify 3\% of the Neanderthal genome that is putatively introgressed from ancient humans, and estimate that the gene flow occurred between 200-300kya. We find no convincing evidence that negative selection acted against these regions. Finally, we predict that 1\% of the Denisovan genome was introgressed from an unsequenced, but highly diverged, archaic hominin ancestor. About 15\% of these “super-archaic” regions—comprising at least about 4Mb—were, in turn, introgressed into modern humans and continue to exist in the genomes of people alive today.},

By deriving the distribution of branch duration under the SMC’ model, defined as the genomic interval spanned by a branch of the ARG until it is disrupted by recombination, we benchmark the quality of ARGs produced by several reconstruction tools: ARGweaver, Relate, tsinfer and tsdate, and ARG-Needle. Further, we develop an accurate and powerful ARG-based test for the presence of chromosomal inversions, based on the idea that suppression of recombination in individuals heterozygous for an inversion has a detectable impact on branch duration.},

	abstract = {Movement of individuals between populations or demes is often restricted, especially between geographically isolated populations. The structured coalescent provides an elegant theoretical framework for describing how movement between populations shapes the genealogical history of sampled individuals and thereby structures genetic variation within and between populations. However, in the presence of recombination an individual may inherit different regions of their genome from different parents, resulting in a mosaic of genealogical histories across the genome, which can be represented by an Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG). In this case, different genomic regions may have different ancestral histories and so different histories of movement between populations. Recombination therefore poses an additional challenge to phylogeographic methods that aim to reconstruct the movement of individuals from genealogies, although also a potential benefit in that different loci may contain additional information about movement. Here, we introduce the Structured Coalescent with Ancestral Recombination (SCAR) model, which builds on recent approximations to the structured coalescent by incorporating recombination into the ancestry of sampled individuals. The SCAR model allows us to infer how the migration history of sampled individuals varies across the genome from ARGs, and improves estimation of key population genetic parameters such as population sizes, recombination rates and migration rates. Using the SCAR model, we explore the potential and limitations of phylogeographic inference using full ARGs. We then apply the SCAR to lineages of the recombining fungus Aspergillus flavus sampled across the United States to explore patterns of recombination and migration across the genome.},

	abstract = {Effective population size characterizes the genetic variability in a population and is a parameter of paramount importance in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Kingman’s coalescent process enables inference of past population dynamics directly from molecular sequence data, and researchers have developed a number of flexible coalescent-based models for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the effective population size as a function of time. Major goals of demographic reconstruction include identifying driving factors of effective population size, and understanding the association between the effective population size and such factors. Building upon Bayesian nonparametric coalescent-based approaches, we introduce a flexible framework that incorporates time-varying covariates that exploit Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of effective population size trajectories. To approximate the posterior distribution, we adapt efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models. Incorporating covariates into the demographic inference framework enables the modeling of associations between the effective population size and covariates while accounting for uncertainty in population histories. Furthermore, it can lead to more precise estimates of population dynamics. We apply our model to four examples. We reconstruct the demographic history of raccoon rabies in North America and find a significant association with the spatiotemporal spread of the outbreak. Next, we examine the effective population size trajectory of the DENV-4 virus in Puerto Rico along with viral isolate count data and find similar cyclic patterns. We compare the population history of the HIV-1 CRF02\_AG clade in Cameroon with HIV incidence and prevalence data and find that the effective population size is more reflective of incidence rate. Finally, we explore the hypothesis that the population dynamics of musk ox during the Late Quaternary period were related to climate change.

New developments have made it possible to infer ARGs at scale, enabling many new applications in population and statistical genetics. This rapid progress, however, has led to a substantial gap opening between theory and practice. Standard mathematical formalisms, based on exhaustively detailing the "events" that occur in the history of a sample, are insufficient to describe the outputs of current methods. Moreover, we argue that the underlying assumption that all events can be known and precisely estimated is fundamentally unsuited to the realities of modern, population-scale datasets. We propose an alternative mathematical formulation that encompasses the outputs of recent methods and can capture the full richness of modern large-scale datasets. By defining this ARG encoding in terms of specific genomes and their intervals of genetic inheritance, we avoid the need to exhaustively list (and estimate) all events. The effects of multiple events can be aggregated in different ways, providing a natural way to express many forms of approximate and partial knowledge about the recombinant ancestry of a sample.},

	abstract = {Study sample sizes in human genetics are growing rapidly, and in due course it will become routine to analyze samples with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of individuals. In addition to posing computational challenges, such large sample sizes call for carefully reexamining the theoretical foundation underlying commonly used analytical tools. Here, we study the accuracy of the coalescent, a central model for studying the ancestry of a sample of individuals. The coalescent arises as a limit of a large class of random mating models, and it is an accurate approximation to the original model provided that the population size is sufficiently larger than the sample size. We develop a method for performing exact computation in the discrete-time Wright–Fisher (DTWF) model and compare several key genealogical quantities of interest with the coalescent predictions. For recently inferred demographic scenarios, we find that there are a significant number of multiple- and simultaneous-merger events under the DTWF model, which are absent in the coalescent by construction. Furthermore, for large sample sizes, there are noticeable differences in the expected number of rare variants between the coalescent and the DTWF model. To balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, we propose a hybrid algorithm that uses the DTWF model for the recent past and the coalescent for the more distant past. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid method with only a handful of generations of the DTWF model leads to a frequency spectrum that is quite close to the prediction of the full DTWF model.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Haplotypes from one or multiple related populations share a common genealogical history. If this shared genealogy can be inferred from haplotypes, it can be very useful for many population genetics problems. However, with the presence of recombination, the genealogical history of haplotypes is complex and cannot be represented by a single genealogical tree. Therefore, inference of genealogical history with recombination is much more challenging than the case of no recombination.

Results
In this paper, we present a new approach called RENT+ for the inference of local genealogical trees from haplotypes with the presence of recombination. RENT+ builds on a previous genealogy inference approach called RENT, which infers a set of related genealogical trees at different genomic positions. RENT+ represents a significant improvement over RENT in the sense that it is more effective in extracting information contained in the haplotype data about the underlying genealogy than RENT. The key components of RENT+ are several greatly enhanced genealogy inference rules. Through simulation, we show that RENT+ is more efficient and accurate than several existing genealogy inference methods. As an application, we apply RENT+ in the inference of population demographic history from haplotypes, which outperforms several existing methods.

Availability and Implementation

RENT+ is implemented in Java, and is freely available for download from: https://github.com/SajadMirzaei/RentPlus.

We describe a new ancestral recombination graph inference algorithm that scales to large genome-wide datasets and demonstrate its accuracy on real and simulated data. We then generate a genome-wide ancestral recombination graph including human and archaic hominin genomes. From this, we generate a map within human genomes of archaic ancestry and of genomic regions not shared with archaic hominins either by admixture or incomplete lineage sorting. We find that only 1.5 to 7\% of the modern human genome is uniquely human. We also find evidence of multiple bursts of adaptive changes specific to modern humans within the past 600,000 years involving genes related to brain development and function.},

	abstract = {Throughout history, the population size of modern humans has varied considerably due to changes in environment, culture, and technology. More accurate estimates of population size changes, and when they occurred, should provide a clearer picture of human colonization history and help remove confounding effects from natural selection inference. Demography influences the pattern of genetic variation in a population, and thus genomic data of multiple individuals sampled from one or more present-day populations contain valuable information about the past demographic history. Recently, Li and Durbin developed a coalescent-based hidden Markov model, called the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC), for a pair of chromosomes (or one diploid individual) to estimate past population sizes. This is an efficient, useful approach, but its accuracy in the very recent past is hampered by the fact that, because of the small sample size, only few coalescence events occur in that period. Multiple genomes from the same population contain more information about the recent past, but are also more computationally challenging to study jointly in a coalescent framework. Here, we present a new coalescent-based method that can efficiently infer population size changes from multiple genomes, providing access to a new store of information about the recent past. Our work generalizes the recently developed sequentially Markov conditional sampling distribution framework, which provides an accurate approximation of the probability of observing a newly sampled haplotype given a set of previously sampled haplotypes. Simulation results demonstrate that we can accurately reconstruct the true population histories, with a significant improvement over the PSMC in the recent past. We apply our method, called diCal, to the genomes of multiple human individuals of European and African ancestry to obtain a detailed population size change history during recent times.},

We have studied a number of variables based on simulations of sample histories, and some analytical results are derived. Consider the leftmost nucleotide in the sequences. We show that the number of nucleotides sharing a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with the leftmost nucleotide is ≃log(1 + 4N Lr)/4Nr when two sequences are compared, where L denotes sequence length in nucleotides, and r the recombination rate between any two neighboring nucleotides per generation. For larger samples, the number of nucleotides sharing MRCA with the leftmost nucleotide decreases and becomes almost independent of 4N Lr. Further, we show that a segment of the sequences sharing a MRCA consists in mean of 3/8Nr nucleotides, when two sequences are compared, and that this decreases toward 1/4Nr nucleotides when the whole population is sampled. A measure of the correlation between the genealogies of two nucleotides on two sequences is introduced. We show analytically that even when the nucleotides are separated by a large genetic distance, but share MRCA, the genealogies will show only little correlation. This is surprising, because the time until the two nucleotides shared MRCA is reciprocal to the genetic distance. Using simulations, the mean time until all positions in the sample have found a MRCA increases logarithmically with increasing sequence length and is considerably lower than a theoretically predicted upper bound. On the basis of simulations, it turns out that important properties of the coalescent with recombinations of the whole population are reflected in the properties of a sample of low size.},
